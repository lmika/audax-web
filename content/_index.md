The Audax Toolset is a set of small, terminal based UI (TUI, sometimes called "Rougelike") tools for
administering AWS services.

They were built to make it easy to do quick things with
common AWS services, such as DynamoDB, without having to learn incantations with the CLI or
go to the AWS console itself.  This keeps you focused on your task and saves you from
breaking concentration, especially if you do a lot in the terminal.

## The Toolset

The set of tools available are:

- [Dynamo-Browse](/dynamo-browse): Browse DynamoDB tables
