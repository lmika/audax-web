module: resultset
type: type
docs: |
  Holds a collection of items returned from a query, or presented to a user.
  
  A specific item of a result-set can be retrived using the subscript option.  For example, `result[21]` will
  return the 21st item of the result-set from the first item. A negative index can be used to retrieve an
  item from the last item.
  
  There is no guarantee to the ordering of items within the result-set, although items are usually
  ordered based on the partition and sort key.
